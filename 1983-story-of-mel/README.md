# Folklore: The Story of Mel
![story-of-mel](story-of-mel.jpg)

[The Story of Mel](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html) was written by Ed Nather in 1983. It is satire poking fun at the "Real Programmer" myth/trope.

The story describes Mel's attempt to port a blackjack program from the LGP-30 to the RPC-4000 and the ethical dilemnas that arose.
